Rebuilt from GHost++ base build 16.2 ([r384](https://code.google.com/p/ghostcb/source/detail?r=384)), GHost++ CB is more stable and better than ever before.

Just like before, GHost++ CB is based off of GHost++, and only includes small changes which were requested or submitted from the GHost++ forums (codelain.com/forum).

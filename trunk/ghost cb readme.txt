Introduction
============

On top of the commands that are shown in "ghost\readme.txt" there are also commands and features that are added in this custom version.
A lot of the coding has not been actually done by me, but other users from the forums.  I merely insert their code into this public release build.
The SVN Repository is located at http://ghostcb.googlecode.com
